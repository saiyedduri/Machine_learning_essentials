    "\n",

    "### What's going on?\n",
    "\n",
    "Periodic convolution (also called circular convolution) for signal $u$ and filter $v$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(u *_{p} v)[n] = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{M-1} u[(n - \\ell) \\bmod N] \\cdot v[\\ell]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You do this sum for every $n = 0, 1, \\dots, N - 1$.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why?\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "- For small filters (e.g., $M \\ll N$), the direct method is cheaper: $M \\cdot N$ can be less than $N \\log N$  \n",

    "\n",
    "This just says:\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering in the frequency domain (multiply DFTs) is equivalent to convolution in the time domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fundamental identity in signal processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\hat{u} \\cdot \\hat{f}) = u *_{p} f$$\n",

    "So computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\hat{u} \\cdot \\hat{f})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is the same as doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = f *_{p} u$$\n",

    "###  5. Low-pass Filter and the Dirichlet Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In particular, the low-pass filter is the periodic convolution with the Dirichlet kernel.\"\n",

    "This refers to using frequency truncation as a low-pass filter.\n",
