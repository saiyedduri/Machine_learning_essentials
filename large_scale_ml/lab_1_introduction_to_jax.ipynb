    "### Con's\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to efficiently compile programs just-in-time in JAX, the functions need to be written with certain constraints:\n",
    "- The functions are not allowed to have side-effects, meaning that they are not allowed to affect any variable outside of their namespaces.\n",
    "For instance, in-place operations affect a variable even outside of the function.\n",
    "Moreover, stochastic operations such as `torch.rand(...)` change the global state of pseudo random number generators, which is not allowed in functional JAX (we will see later how JAX handles random number generation).\n",
    "- JAX compiles the functions based on anticipated shapes of all arrays/tensors in the function.\n",
    "  This becomes problematic if the shapes or the program flow within the function depends on the values of the tensor.\n",
    "  For instance, in the operation `y = x[x>3]`, the shape of `y` depends on how many values of `x` are greater than 3.\n",
    "- Since JAX is typically used in the machine learning context, it's standard data type is `float32` (single precision) and not as one might expect `float64` (double precision).\n",
    "  \n",
    "We will discuss more of these constraints in this and the following notebooks.\n",
    "However, in most common cases of training neural networks, it is straightforward to write functions within these constraints."

For example, PyTorch uses `torch.Tensor` as data arrays on which it defines several operations like matrix multiplication, taking the mean of the elements, etc. In JAX, this basic API strongly resembles the one of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and even has the same name in JAX (`jax.numpy`).

A `DeviceArray` object is *immutable*, which means that no in-place operations are possible. The reason for this goes back to our discussion in the introduction: JAX requires programs to be \"pure\" functions, i.e. no effects on variables outside of the function are allowed. Allowing in-place operations of variables would make the program analysis for JAX's just-in-time compilation difficult. Instead, we can use the expression `b.at[0].set(1)` which, analogous to the in-place operation, returns a new array which is identical to `b`, except that its value at the first position is 1.\n",

Finding such cases to improve efficiency and optimizing the code to take full advantage of the available accelerator hardware is one of the big selling points of JAX. It achieves that by *compiling functions just-in-time* with [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) (Accelerated Linear Algebra), using their jaxpr representation.

    "During coding, we likely want to debug our model and sometimes print out intermediate values. In JAX, when jitting functions, this is not as straightforward. As we could see from the previous cells, a print statement is only executed once during compilation, and afterwards removed since it is not part of the jaxpr representation. Furthermore, there can be issues when tracking NaNs in your code (see the [sharp bits tutorial](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#debugging-nans)), and errors like out-of-bounds indexing are silently handled on accelerators by returning -1 instead of an error (see the corresponding section in the [sharp bits tutorial](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#out-of-bounds-indexing)). However, if necessary, one can either run the unjitted version of the forward pass first, and even introduce print statements to the jitted version where needed (see [here](https://github.com/google/jax/issues/196) for a great explanation). Still, it is not as straight-forward as in PyTorch, for example."
