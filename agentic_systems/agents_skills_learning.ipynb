    "\n",
    "> **Analogy:** Imagine you're training a new employee. Instead of explaining everything from scratch each day, you give them an employee handbook. When they need to do a specific task (like expense reports), they flip to that chapter. Skills work the same way for Claude.\n",

    "2. **Instructions** — The actual how-to guide\n",

    "For more complex skills, you can add extra files:\n",

    "2. Claude sees it has a \"PDF skill\" available (from the metadata)\n",
    "3. Claude reads the main `SKILL.md` file\n",
    "4. Claude sees it should also read `forms.md` for form-filling instructions\n",
